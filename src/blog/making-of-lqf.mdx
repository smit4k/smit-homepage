### How it Started

We've all know JSON, YAML, and TOML. They're popular configuration languages. They're great,
dont get me wrong, but I wanted something different, something a bit more simple, readeable, uniform, and
most importantly, something _aesthetically pleasing_. I also had a lot of time to spend, as
it was the end of the school year and all of my exams were over, so this was the perfect time to
make my own configuration language, LQF, the Lightweight Quick Format (yes naming is hard)

### The Design

I wanted LQF to be extremely simple and revolve around a singular symbol. 
The symbol of choice is one of my favorite symbols, the `>` (greater than operator).
It represents an arrow to the right, and it's very readable.

#### The Basics

A config language needs to have **sections** and **assignments**

___

##### Sections

**Sections** begin with a `>` followed immediately by a section name.

Example:
```
> settings
```

___

##### Assignments

**Assignments** are key-value pairs within a section.
You can assign using `>>`

Example:
```
username >> "smit4k"
active >> true
```

___

##### Comments

Another feature that configuration languages have are **comments**.
**Comments** in LQF start with `#` and continue to the end of the line.

Example:
```
# This is a comment
```

___

#### Supported Values

LQF supports a lot of values, when assigning a key to a value. Take a look at the t
| Type       | Syntax Example             | Description                   |
|------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| String     | `"Hello, world!"`           | Double-quoted text           |
| Number     | `42`, `3.14`                | Integers, Floating points    |
| Boolean    | `true`, `false`             | Logical values               |
| Null       | `null`                      | Null value                   |
| Array      | `[1, 2, 3]`, `["a", "b"]`   | Comma-separated list of values inside square brackets |

### That's It!

That's the entire language, as of now. It's essentially completed.
It's **simple**, **readable**, and looks **awesome** (in my opinion). I'm really happy
about the design.

If you would like to **contribute** to the language, you can check out the specifications
in my Github repo, [smit4k/lqf-spec](https://github.com/smit4k/lqf-spec), all of the info about the language
is there.
